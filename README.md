# Weather App React
This project is build on REACT framework with bootstrap elements.[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this app about?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iondrimba/images/master/weather.gif?raw=true" alt="Demo" style="max-width: 30%; display: inline-block;" data-target="animated-image.originalImage">

In this web app you can see the weather at a specific time. You can also change the cities to see their weather too. Another feature of this app is that you can choose the hours range to see the weather's lowest and highest temperature.

## How this app works ?
Our project works with the API to display up-to-date information about weather temperature and times. We take this information from [openweathermap.org]( "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5";)


## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Optimization
To optimize our project and rid of extra rerenders, we used Redux.

## Resources and tools used :
 > [React](https://reactjs.org/) version "18.2.0"

 > [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) version"2.7.0",

 > [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) version "8.0.5"

 >[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)  version "1.57.1"

 > [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) version "18.2.0"

 > [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) version "2.29.4"

 ## React
React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.

## React Bootstrap
React-Bootstrap is a complete re-implementation of the Bootstrap components using React. It has no dependency on either bootstrap.js or jQuery. If you have React setup and React-Bootstrap installed, you have everything you need.

The CSS and details of Bootstrap components are rather opinionated and lengthy. React-Bootstrap simplifies this by condensing the original Bootstrap into React-styled components.

## Redux
Why Redux is so popular?
Redux allows you to manage your app's state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable. It makes it easier to reason about changes occurring in your app.

 ## ReactDOM
 The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside the React model if you need to.

 ## Moment
 We'll be using a library called moment js. A lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
